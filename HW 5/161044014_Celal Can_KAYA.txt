DoS is stands for Denial of Service.Nowadays, DoS attacks are very dangerous.For example, a group of cyber criminals are
attacking to a bank.During the attack you wont be able to do opetaion like sending money.DoS is a attack type which uses a 
lot of computers.Usually computer which is full of viruses sends tons of request to a server.Then the server is not be able 
to answer those requests.If there is enough computers which sends tons of request, no way to block this DoS attack.First, 
the server trying to answer requests but then server will down.Server is not able to decide which request is real request.
If you have more parallel servers maybe you can avoid the DoS attacks.Because if a server down, another parallel server is
continue to answer the requests.But if the DoS attack is wide enough you are not be able to avoid it.
